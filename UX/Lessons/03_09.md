# Trust in AI

To create trust between humans and their virtual assistants, its important to follow the following criteria:

- Be competent: If the system is competent enough to propose a reasonable solution to the problems faced, it will be a relied upon source;
- Be honest and reliable: Instead of trying to always pretend that it has an answer to the problem specified, the system can direct the user to a right path to find it, or request more inputs to understand the problem better and try to solve it;

# Data visualization

Graphical representation of data in tables, maps, diagrams, graphs, charts...;

## Steps for creating visual data

- Transformation of brute data into a table of data;
- Apply a visual mapping technique to transform the table of data into something visual;
- [Transformation of the visual mapping](#transforming-the-visual-mapping) por better visualization;

## Transforming the visual mapping

- Localization test: Additional info about a single item in the map;
- Point of view control: Zoom and changing focus of the images to provide better understanding;
- Distortion: Distorce image according to an inputted context (time, density, ... changing the results)

## Visual mapping types

- Charts: Express numerical values using visual representations;
- Diagram: Simplified scheme of a topic;
- infographic: Charts with textual explanation;
- Map: Represent a scaled version of a location;
- Tables: Organize data in rows and columns in a standardized way;
- Panels: Various information from different topics displayed in a single structure;

## Visual mapping usage

- Comparison;
- Composition: Represent the parts of a whole;
- Distribution: Represent the correlation between variables;
