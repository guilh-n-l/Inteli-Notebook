# Solving linear systems

## Classifying linear systems

- Consistent systems: Only an unique solution exists;
- Inconsistent systems: There are no solutions;
- Undetermined systems: There is an infinite number of solutions;

$$
\text{Considering $m$ as the number of unknowns, $n$ as the number of equations and}
$$
$$
\det\left(C\right) = 
\begin{vmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \text{...} & a_{1n}\\
a_{21} & a_{22} &  \text{...} & a_{2n}\\
\text{...} & \text{...} & \text{...} & \text{...}\\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \text{...} & a_{nn}\\
\end{vmatrix}
$$
$$
m > n \implies \text{Inconsistent system}
$$
$$
m = n \text{ and $\det\left(C\right) \ne 0$}\implies \text{Consistent system}
$$
$$
m = n \text{ and $\det\left(C\right) = 0$}\implies \text{Inconsistent system}
$$
