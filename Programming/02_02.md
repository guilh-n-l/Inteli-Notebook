# Artificial Intelligence 

Composition of various types of technology, such as neural networks, algorithms and learning systems that try to simulate the human intelligence;

## Technologies used

- Machine Learning: Data evaluation that automates the development of analytical patterns;  
- Deep Learning: Neural networks with a number of abstraction layers, Training machines to do human tasks (Image recognition, Locate speech patterns...);
- Natural Language Processing: Training machines to comprehend meaning behind texts;

## Types of AI

### In relation of purpose 

- Machine intelligence: Machines executing programmed tasks;
- Humanoid intelligence: Machines that can mimic human behavior;
- Collective intelligence: Networks that can make decisions based on a set of individual agents;

### In relation of mode of operation

- Reactive: Not capable of learning from experience, limited to what's pre-programmed;
- Limited memory: Aware of pass experiences, of which can be harnessed for making future decisions;
- Theory of mind: Machine acquire decision-making capabilities equal to humans (Can understand beliefs, intentions and desires); 
- Self-aware: Have their own mental states and beliefs;
