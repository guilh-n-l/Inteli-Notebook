# Types of variables in data analytics

- Decision: Serve as base to find a certain conclusion;
- Controllable: Model generates variables from the data received from decision variables;
- Uncontrollable Model generates predictions and assign them as variables;

# Types of models in data analytics

## Based on format
- Conceptual: Create high-level representations of relationships between variables
  - Used to create data visualization;
  - Used to create databases;
- Symbolic / Mathematical: Manipulate data using symbols, rules and logic to represent relationships;
- Heuristic: Ruled by empirical tests;

## Based on purpose

- Simulation: Try to represent the real world, to only then test variables;
- Optimization: Try to find the best alternative between choices;
- Prescriptive: Try to find the best variables to optimize the best outcome;
- Predictive: Estimate future values based in present variables;
- Descriptive: Provide insights about current or past trends;

# Testing hypothesis

## Types of hypothesis

- Null hypothesis $(H_0)$: Affirm an equality of a parameter and a value or interval o values (Ex.: $\mu = 40kg$) 
- Alternative hypothesis $(H_a)$: Affirm an inequality of a parameter and a value or interval o values, refuting $H_0$ (Ex.: $\mu \ne 40kg$) 

## Types of errors:

- False negative: Rejecting $H_0$ even though it's true;
- False positive: Not rejecting $H_0$ even though it's false;

# Inferential statistics

## Central limit theorem

Sampling from a larger set of values, one can infer probabilities using the central limit theorem;

$$
s = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
$$
\bar{x} \to \mu
$$

Being $X$ a random variable related to a population and $\bar{X}$ that same random variable to the sample;

the z-score of the sample is:

$$
z = \frac{\bar{x}_p-\mu}{s}
$$
