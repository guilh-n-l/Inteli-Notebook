# Linear Regression

## Calculating the residual sum squared 

After finding the regression line, we can measure the quality of the adjustment by calculating the residual sum squared. The smaller the number, the better is the regression line represented;

$$
RS_S = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2
$$
$$
\small{
    \hat y_i \rightarrow \text{Predicted value (From regression line)}
}
$$
$$
\small{
    y_i \rightarrow \text{Real value}
}
$$
