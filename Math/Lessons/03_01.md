# Types of models in data analytics

## Based on format
- Conceptual: Create high-level representations of relationships between variables
  - Used to create data visualization;
  - Used to create databases;
- Symbolic / Mathematical: Manipulate data using symbols, rules and logic to represent relationships;
- Heuristic: Ruled by empirical tests;

## Based on purpose

- Simulation: Try to represent the real world, to only then test variables;
- Optimization: Try to find the best alternative between choices;
- Prescriptive: Try to find the best variables to optimize the best outcome;
- Predictive: Estimate future values based in present variables;
- Descriptive: Provide insights about current or past trends;
