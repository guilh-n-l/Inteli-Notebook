# CRISP-DM

Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining is an agile methodology created to support the projects involving machine learning, data analysis and data mining;

1. Business understanding: Understanding the problem at hand to be solved;
2. Data understanding: Comparing the data needed to the data obtained and classify it according to it's faults and qualities;
3. Data preparation: standardize the data formats and clean data;
4. Modeling: Use exploratory analysis, select variables that need to be included;
5. Evaluation & Deployment: Evaluate the effectiveness of the model and prepare to launch it;

# Data structuring

- **Structured data:** Rigid structure which was previously planned before used to store anything; 

    **_Note:_** Databases, Sign up forms... are forms of structured data;

- **Semi-structured data:** Data that has structure, but does not conform to a formal schema;

    **_Note:_** XML, JSON... are forms of semi-structured data;

- **Non-structured data:** No previous defined structure that contains information needed;

    **_Note:_** Notes, documents, images, reports... are forms of non-structured data;

# Types of learning

- Supervised: Model is given input and output data and the algorithm will map the correlation between them;
- Unsupervised: Model is only given input and the algorithm will find relationships between data;
