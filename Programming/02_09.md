# Data quality analysis

You can consider a number of parameters to analyze the qualify of the data possessed, such as the following:

- The data source reliability;
- Precision of the data;
- Accessibility / availability of the data;
- Security and privacy of the data;
- Data richness;
- Consistency, organization of the data;
- Data relevancy (If it still applies for the current time and if it applies for the current study);
- Granularity: The amount of detail;

# Data taxonomy

Data can be categorized as the following:

- Structured:
    - Categorical: Non numerical measures used to describe things or people;
        - Nominal: Can't be ordered (Sex, ethnicity, civil state...);
        - Ordinal: Can be ordered (Age, height, schooling...);
    - Numerical: Numerical values for specific variables;
        - Intervals: Relative to a certain measurement without an absolute zero;
        - Rational: Has absolute zero;
- Semi-structured or Non-structured:
    - Textual;
    - Multimedia;
        - Image;
        - Video;
        - Audio;
    - XML/JSON;

# Descriptive statistics

## Basic definitions

- Population: Set of units that share something in common and are analyzed for a study;
- Sample: Part of the population that can be analyzed by itself;
- Variable: a certain characteristic in common between units of the population;

**_Note:_** Variables are **quantitative** if they can be ordered in a numeric scale and **qualitative** if they can't;
