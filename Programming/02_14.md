# Data pre-processing

The tasks involved to prepare the data for the processing can be listed below:

- Cleaning: Input of absent values and removal or correction of noisy (contain imprecisions, irrelevant or wrongly inputted data) data;
- Integration: The unification of different databases in a single place;
- Reduction: Removal of redundant or unnecessary data;
- Transformation: Standardization of data to allow usage in various data mining techniques;
- Discretization: Turn continuous values into discrete values to turn them easier to manipulate;

## Handling certain occurrences

1. Absent values:
    - Ignore the object;
    - Input manually by empirical observation;
    - Input the default value;
    - Hot-deck (Inputting the same value from similar objects);
    - Input a value according to past observations;
    - Input median, mode...;
    - Input median, mode... from similar objects;
    - Using other predictive models to choose an input;
2. Noisy data:
    1. Clustering: Group data based in their similarities;
3. Continuous values:
    1. Binning: Group continuous values into groups of discrete values (Ex.: $0 \rightarrow 5'9 \implies \text{short} \,\&\, 5'9 \rightarrow \infty \implies \text{tall}$);
4. Inconsistent data: Choose a standard and change the values accordingly;

# Distance metrics

## K-Nearest Neighbors

The ideia in this method is to predict the label of a new data point based on the k-nearest neighbors of that point in the training data;
