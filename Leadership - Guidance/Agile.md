## Definition of Workflow (DoW)

**DoW** is when the system flow is defined so that the members can comprehend how to get involved;

1. Define individual card units;
2. Schedule deadlines for each individual unit using the **Service Level Expectation (Time estimation to complete the unit)**;
3. Set categorizes that encapsulate the state of each unit (WIP, Done, To do...);

## Metrics

- Throughput: Amount of units that need to be delivered in a certain amount of time;
- Cycle time: Time WIP $\rightarrow$ Done;
- Lead time: Time To do $\rightarrow$ Done;
- WIP: Amount of units in WIP;
- Little's law: Global analysis;
- Class of Service (CoS): Set of policies to prioritize units according to unpredictable or uncertain situations
