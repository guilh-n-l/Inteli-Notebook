# ELT and ETL

- Extracting: Data collection from various sources;
- Loading: Store the data collected in a data storage; 
- Transforming: Data pre-processing;

The order of the steps above can differ and each one has it's advantages:

- ELT:
    - Takes advantage of the data storage computing power to do basic transformations (Higher speed);
    - When cloud-based the solutions or updates are automated (No need for maintenance);
- ETL:
    - Avoid compliance issues (Private data is not stored);
    - Because it's an older method, there are more well-developed tools and platforms that can be used;
