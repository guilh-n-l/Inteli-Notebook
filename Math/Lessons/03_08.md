# Multiple variable functions

## Contour lines

A curve in to dimensions in which the value of the function is a constant

$$
f(x,\,y) = k
$$

# Partial derivatives

$$
\frac{\partial f(x,\,y)}{\partial x} = \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{f(x+h,\, y) - f(x,\, y)}{h}
$$

**_Note:_** To solve partial derivatives, you need to treat the remaining variable as a constant and solve the derivative normally using the differentiated variable;

## Notation

$$
\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right) = f_{xx}
$$
$$
\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial xy} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)=f_{xy}
$$

## Chain rule

$$
\frac{dz}{du} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{dx}{du} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{dy}{du}; x = g(u) \,\And\, y = h(u)
$$

**_Note:_** If $x$ and $y$ are both functions of multiple variables, the formula changes to the one below

$$
\frac{dz}{du} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial u}; x = g(u, v) \,\And\, y = h(u, v) 
$$

$$
\frac{dz}{dv} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}; x = g(u, v) \,\And\, y = h(u, v) 
$$
